# Algorithmic-Unsupervised-Clustering
Business Data Cluster Insights leverages unsupervised learning—specifically hierarchical and k-means clustering—to uncover hidden patterns in diverse business datasets. By segmenting data into meaningful groups (clusters), this project transforms raw, multi-dimensional data into actionable business insights.

Key Components:
University Rankings: Clusters over 1,300 American colleges based on academic, financial, and categorical metrics. These clusters help impute missing values and differentiate institutions (e.g., research-intensive vs. teaching-focused).
Pharmaceutical Industry: Uses financial variables from 21 pharmaceutical firms to reveal distinct groups such as blue-chip, emerging innovators, and steady performers.
Customer Rating of Breakfast Cereals: Applies hierarchical clustering to nutritional and consumer rating data, identifying natural groupings—including a cluster of “healthy cereals” that could benefit elementary school cafeterias.
Marketing to Frequent Fliers: Clusters 3,999 frequent flier records using both hierarchical (Ward’s method) and k-means clustering, uncovering segments (e.g., high-engagement vs. low-activity customers) that inform targeted mileage offers.
This project showcases how clustering can simplify complex datasets and deliver strategic insights across multiple business domains.
