# Algorithmic-Unsupervised-Clustering
Business Data Cluster Insights leverages unsupervised learning—specifically hierarchical and k-means clustering—to uncover hidden patterns in diverse business datasets. By segmenting data into meaningful groups (clusters), this project transforms raw, multi-dimensional data into actionable business insights.
